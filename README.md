Although I am now retired from LLNL, I am still active supporting various software projects.

My interests encompass scientific data models, scientific data & software interoperability, scientific software sustainability engineering, scalable I/O and visualization and analysis tooling and workflows. In addition, I try to advocate for inclusive practices as a core value throughout the scientific computing community.

I work on [VisIt](https://visit.llnl.gov), [Silo](https://silo.llnl.gov), [H5Z-ZFP](https://h5z-zfp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [BSSw.io](https://bssw.io).

I am an advocate for [HDF5](https://hdfgroup.org), [Sustainable Research Pathways in High Performance Computing (SRP-HPC)](https://shinstitute.org/sustainable-research-pathways-2024-workshop/)
